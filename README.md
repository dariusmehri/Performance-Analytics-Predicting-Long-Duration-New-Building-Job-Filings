# Predicting Long Duration New Building Job Filings

Job filings that require numerous plan exams to approve consume scarce DOB resources and reduce the quality of City services.

Goal: Improve DOB process efficiency and City services by speeding up time to approve job filings

Objective of the predictive model: 

Label new job filings that are predicted to take many plan exams to approve.

Once job filings are labeled, they are given special consideration to speed up approval process.
